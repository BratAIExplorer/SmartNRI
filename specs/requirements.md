# SmartNRI — Product Requirements

**Version:** 1.0 | **Phase:** 1 (Malaysia) | **Date:** 21 Feb 2026

---

## Problem Statement

Indian expats in Malaysia have no single, trustworthy, non-commercial reference for navigating the intersection of Malaysian government rules (Employment Pass, tax, driving licenses) and Indian government regulations (FEMA, NRE/NRO banking, ITR filing, OCI). Existing platforms (SBNRI, Vance) are transactional — they want to sell products. WhatsApp groups spread unverified claims. The result is confusion, missed deadlines, and compliance risk.

---

## Vision

SmartNRI is a fully autonomous, hands-free, government-verified reference platform for Indian expats. It is the **Independent Auditor in your pocket** — it does not sell, it only informs. Users verify for themselves using the direct source links provided with every item.

---

## Phase 1 Target Audience

- Primary: Indian expats in Malaysia (KL, PJ, Penang)
- Entry channel: WhatsApp sharing among trusted networks
- Day 1 Users: Founder's family, friends, and colleagues

---

## Non-Goals (Phase 1)

- No Singapore content
- No user accounts or login
- No live chatbot (placeholder UI only)
- No community forum
- No native mobile app
- No financial product sales or recommendations

---

## Core Features: Phase 1

  - Up to 3 action bullet points
  - Direct clickable link to the source document
  - Publication date
- Standard footer on every card: *"This is a reference guide. Verify with the linked official source before taking action."*
- Content refreshes automatically every 24 hours via the automation pipeline

### 2. The Compliance Checklist (Tab: "My Checklist")
- Static checklist, client-side only — no data sent to server
- Categories:
  - **Banking Compliance**: Account types (NRE/NRO/Resident), FEMA rules, nominee registration
  - **Document Reminders**: Document type (dropdown) + expiry date only. Reminder lead-time option (90/60/30 days).
  - **Investment Self-Audit**: PIS account, FATCA compliance, prohibited investments (PPF for NRIs, agricultural land)

- "No Change" shortcut on 6-month re-check (tap once to confirm no update needed)
- Privacy statement visible: *"We never store account numbers, document scans, or personal financial data. This checklist runs entirely in your browser."*

### 3. Ask + Trusted Voices (Tab: "Ask")
- Search bar placeholder (Phase 1: non-functional, shows "Coming Soon" on submit)
- Pre-populated Suggested Questions (6 chips as visual teaser)

## Verification Framework (Mandatory)

Every published item MUST have a source. The source tier determines the badge:

| Tier | Badge | Example Source |
|---|---|---|
| Government circular (`gov.in` / `gov.my`) | 🟢 GREEN | esd.imi.gov.my/announcement |
| Reputable advisory (KPMG, law firm, ET) | 🟠 ORANGE | KPMG GMS Flash Alert |
| Trend-verified, cross-referenced | 🔵 BLUE | Reddit question + gov.in confirmation |
| Time-sensitive action required | 🔴 RED | FEMA violation risk |

If no Tier 1 source is found: **do not publish.** Log the item as `SKIPPED` in the pipeline.

---

## Accessibility & Compliance

- All interactive elements must have unique IDs for accessibility
- Alt text on all images (if any added in future)
- Disclaimer footer pinned to bottom of every tab
- No advice language ("you must", "you should") — only informational language ("the rule states", "the circular confirms")
